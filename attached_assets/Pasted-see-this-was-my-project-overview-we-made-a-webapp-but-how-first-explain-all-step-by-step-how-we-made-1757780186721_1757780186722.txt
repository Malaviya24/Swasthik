Swasthik: The AI Healthcare Chatbot
Documentation for the AI-powered chatbot designed for rural and semi-urban communities.

1. Project Overview
The **Swasthik** (Health Friend) project is a web-based, multilingual AI chatbot. Its primary purpose is to achieve **80% accuracy** in health query responses and a **20% increase** in health awareness in target communities. This solution leverages modern web technologies and powerful AI models to deliver a robust and scalable application. This updated version introduces new communication channels and advanced AI features.

2. Key Features
**Conversational AI:** The system uses a dedicated NLP framework to understand user intent before generating responses with the Gemini API, ensuring higher accuracy.
**SMS & WhatsApp Integration:** The bot can now interact with users via a dedicated phone number, reaching a wider audience.
**AI-Powered Image Analysis:** Users can upload images of a health condition, and the AI will provide a general description and guidance.
**Voice-Enabled Interaction:** The bot can transcribe voice messages and respond with synthesized speech using the **Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS** model.
**Google Search Grounding:** The model is grounded with real-time Google Search, ensuring the information it provides on disease outbreaks and other current events is accurate and up-to-date.
**Persistent Reminders:** Users can ask the chatbot to set reminders for important events like vaccinations or appointments, which are stored securely using **Firestore**.
**Mobile-First Design:** The entire interface is built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean and fully responsive experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
**AI-Powered Symptom Checker:** Guides users through a series of questions to provide information on potential health conditions, always with a strong disclaimer to consult a doctor.
**Medication & Side-Effect Lookup:** Allows users to query the bot for information on specific medicines, including their uses and potential side effects.
**Local Health Center Finder:** Provides directions and contact information for nearby health facilities and accredited professionals using geolocation.
**Personalized Nutritional Guidance:** Generates simple, healthy diet plans and provides nutritional advice based on user queries and localized food availability.
**Interactive First-Aid Guides:** Delivers clear, step-by-step instructions for common medical emergencies and injuries.
**Real-time Health News & Alerts:** Fetches and summarizes the latest public health announcements, disease alerts, or news relevant to a user's query.

4. How It Works
User Input & NLP Processing
A user's message is sent to the backend. The **NLP Framework** first analyzes the text to determine the user's **intent** (e.g., asking for symptoms, setting a reminder, finding a clinic, or getting news) and extracts **entities** (e.g., "cough," "February 15th," "nearby health center").

Backend Logic & API Call
Based on the intent, the backend logic constructs a precise and relevant prompt for the **Gemini API**. This improves accuracy and helps prevent irrelevant or unsafe responses.

Response & Display
The Gemini API generates a response, which is then sent back to the user via the appropriate channel (web, SMS, or WhatsApp). The app also saves any new reminders or appointments to Firestore.

1. User sends query via Web, SMS, or WhatsApp
2. Backend Serverless Function receives the message
3. NLP Framework (Rasa/Dialogflow) analyzes intent & entities
4. Backend constructs a precise prompt for Gemini API
5. Gemini API generates response (Text, Image, or Audio)
6. Backend handles any necessary database actions (Firestore)
7. Response is sent back to the user's channel

8. Choice of NLP Framework: Rasa vs. Dialogflow
Choosing between **Rasa** and **Dialogflow** depends on the project's priorities:

**Rasa:** An open-source, on-premise solution that offers **high customizability and control**. It's ideal if you need to build highly specific, nuanced conversational flows or require the ability to run the model locally. However, it requires more setup and maintenance.
**Dialogflow:** A fully managed service by Google that excels at **rapid prototyping and ease of use**. It's a great choice for quick development and deployment, as Google handles all the infrastructure. While less customizable than Rasa, its integration with other Google Cloud services is seamless.
Both frameworks are scalable and can be deployed on platforms like Google Cloud Functions to handle high traffic from multiple channels.

9. Why This Is the Best Possible Stack
This updated stack is the best possible choice for two key reasons: **specialization** and **synergy**. We're no longer asking a single AI model to do everything. Instead, we're using a dedicated NLP framework to handle the complex, structured task of dialogue management, while the Gemini API focuses on what it does best: generating nuanced, grounded, and multimodal content.

This separation of concerns, combined with the scalability of Google Cloud and Firebase, ensures the application is not only powerful and accurate but also cost-effective and easy to maintain over the long term.
